### Technologies

This project has been created in React Javascript using the following libraries and other help:
- React
- Firebase
- CSS and HTML
- Material UI
- Moment
- Axios
- React Router Dom
- Recharts
- Node.js

### Motivation

I have become very interested in Crypto and the crypto space over the past 3 years. I have invested and regularly use a website
called CoinGecko. I wanted to recreate a similar website (which would be a little more streamlined) and thats where this idea was
born from. I am fascinated by the Crypto space and will be interested going forward in more ideas around building stuff based on
Crypto.

### Next Steps

As we continue to refine and expand the Crypto Price Tracker, here are some planned enhancements:

- Transition from Firebase backend to Express or Python to integrate the CoinSpot API for account linking and trading functionalities, prioritizing security measures.
- Implement a dynamic dark/light mode that seamlessly transforms the interface, including the navbar.
- Enhance the portfolio section by refining the practice investment game for a more immersive experience.
